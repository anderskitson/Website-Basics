The first step to creating a website, is to setup up version control, I like to use the technology git, but there are others, which we won't get into. To setup git on Windows the easiest way is to 

* **Step #1** download git from here https://git-scm.com/download/win. There are other ways, which I can explain if needed. 
* **Step #2** Once git is installed hop over to https://github.com/ and create an account.
* **Step #3**  Next login, if you haven't already and go to the top right of the screen click the plus sign and choose new repository
